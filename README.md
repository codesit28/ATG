<b> with this project we are looking for the smaller businesses/personal looking to send / recieve payments for goods/items globally within minutes for next to nothing. Any amount the fee will stay the same. e.g. 1 ATG hits $1 billion dollars, the fee will still be the same! This is one of our main features! We have noticed, how fees are always fluctuating & now we will be launching this all open source, your welcome to look through the code see what you like. if you have any contributions pls open a issue, this is still a open project so if what your looking for isn't here keep updated by joining our community.</b>
